**Problem Statement - ANN--MNIST-Text-Prediction** \n

A tire pressure sensor fault means that there is a condition affecting the Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) on the vehicle. Sometimes the light might come on to let you know there is a problem where the air pressure of a tire is too high or low. Other times, it means there is a fault with the system. To predict the fault in air pressure system using Artifical Neural Network Deep Learning

Nature of Project : Supervised Learning Classification \n

Dataset file : This part has been reviewed throughly in proposal.pdf file. \n

Requirements : This project requires Python 3.6 and the following Python libraries installed:\n

Python 3.6.6 (Language Used for the project) NumPy (For Scientific Computing) Pandas (For Data Analysis) matplotlib (For Visualization) seaborn (For Visualization) scikit-learn (ML Library for Python) You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.

Execution In a Anaconda terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory Forest_Cover-Type (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:
